Add the Function: Copy and paste the entire function, including the comments, into your theme's functions.php file. This file is typically located in your theme's directory.

Ensure HTML Head Section: Make sure your theme's header.php file includes the <head> section where meta tags are placed. Most WordPress themes include this section by default.

Customize as Needed: You can customize this function further by modifying the content of the meta tags or adding additional meta tags like keywords, author, or any other relevant SEO information.

This function will automatically add the title and description meta tags to single posts and pages. However, for a more comprehensive SEO strategy, consider using a dedicated SEO plugin like Yoast SEO or All in One SEO Pack, which offer advanced features and customization options.
